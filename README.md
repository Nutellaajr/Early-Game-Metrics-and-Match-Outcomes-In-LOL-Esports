# Gold, Kills, and Victory: Predicting Match Outcomes in League of Legends

## Introduction

In professional League of Legends (LoL) esports, early-game performance is often seen as a key predictor of a team‚Äôs eventual victory.  
Metrics such as gold earned and kills secured in the first 25 minutes may offer meaningful insight into game momentum and team coordination.  
This project investigates whether these mid-game indicators ‚Äî specifically, kills and gold at 25 minutes ‚Äî can be used to predict match outcomes.

We also explore role-based performance dynamics, comparing **Mid laners** and **ADCs** (Bot lane carries) to test common beliefs about who ‚Äúcarries‚Äù more often.  
Using data from Oracle‚Äôs Elixir, which includes statistics from hundreds of professional matches, we analyze trends across positions, assess missing data patterns, and build predictive models to classify wins and losses.  
Finally, we evaluate whether the model performs fairly across different regions ‚Äî a key consideration in ensuring equitable performance in esports analytics.

The dataset contains over **70,000 rows**, each representing an individual player or team‚Äôs performance in a single professional match.  
The columns most relevant to our analysis include:

- `killsat25`: Number of champion kills by a player or team at the 25-minute mark  
- `goldat25`: Total gold earned by that point in the match  
- `position`: The player's in-game role (e.g., Mid, Bot, Jungle, Top, Support, or team)  
- `role`: A simplified classification used to distinguish Mid laners from ADCs  
- `result`: Binary outcome indicating if the player‚Äôs team won (`1`) or lost (`0`) the match

These features allow us to explore two central questions:

1. **Can we predict whether a team will win a match based on their kills and gold at 25 minutes?**  
2. **Do Mid laners contribute more early-game action than ADCs, as commonly believed?**

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

We cleaned the dataset by removing columns with over 50% missing values and focusing on rows where `gamelength ‚â• 1500s` (25 minutes).  
Missing values in categorical columns were replaced with `'Unknown'`, and numeric ones filled with median values.

We focused our early analysis on the performance of Mid laners and ADCs at 25 minutes.

## Assessment of Missingness

We tested whether the missingness of `firstbloodvictim` is related to other variables.

- ‚úÖ **firstblood:** Strong dependency (p-value = 0.0)  
- ‚úÖ **position:** Also dependent (p-value = 0.0)  
- ‚úÖ **result:** Appears independent (p-value = 0.476)

This suggests `firstbloodvictim` is **not missing completely at random (MCAR)**.

## Hypothesis Testing

**Question:** Do Mid laners have more kills at 25 minutes than ADCs?

- **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):** No difference in mean kills  
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ):** Mid laners have more kills  
- **Test Statistic:** Mean difference  
- **Observed Difference:** ‚àí0.37  
- **p-value:** 1.0  

‚úÖ **Conclusion:** We fail to reject the null ‚Äî ADCs actually had slightly more kills on average.

## Framing a Prediction Problem

**Question:** Can we predict whether a team will win a match using only kills and gold at 25 minutes?

- **Type:** Binary classification  
- **Target column:** `result` (1 = win, 0 = loss)

---

## Baseline Model

We built a logistic regression using `killsat25` and `goldat25`, scaled using `StandardScaler`, and trained with `train_test_split(random_state=42)`.

**Test Accuracy:** ~0.61  
**Precision (win):** 0.63  
**Recall (win):** 0.49  

The model shows decent ability to use early-game metrics to predict victory.

## Final Model

We added 3 engineered features:
- `kpg` = kills per minute  
- `gold_per_kill` = gold efficiency  
- `fb_indicator` = early-game momentum

We used `GridSearchCV` to tune `C` and `penalty` for logistic regression.

**Best parameters:**  
- C = 0.1  
- penalty = 'l2'

**Test Accuracy:** 0.605 (similar to baseline)  
Though accuracy didn‚Äôt improve, the model now accounts for game pace and early momentum.

## Fairness Analysis

**Question:** Does the model perform worse for minor-region teams?

- **Group X:** Major regions (LCK, LPL, LCS, LEC)  
- **Group Y:** Minor regions (all others)  
- **Metric:** Precision  
- **Observed Difference:** ‚àí0.0347 (minor < major)  
- **p-value:** 0.062

<iframe src="assets/fairness-precision.html" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>

‚úÖ **Conclusion:** The model performs slightly worse for minor-region teams, but not significantly so at p < 0.05.

This project highlights how simple metrics like gold and kills can explain ‚Äî but not fully determine ‚Äî match outcomes in esports. Even in pro games, the rift remains unpredictable.
